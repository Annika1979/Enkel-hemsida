            <h3 class="general">About me</h3>
                <p class="general">About me, well I guess this is I.  
              I was born 42years ago in Sabbatsbergs Hospital as the youngest of five children, and the only girl. 
              As the only girl I was offcourse spoilt, perhaps not by my parents, but by all of my brothers. 
              My mother had hoped for a girl to do girly things with but instead she got a daughter that assisted her father and brothers with fixing the cars and assembling things in the garage. 

              For the past 17 years I have worked within the telecom industry in various companies. At the moment I work as a Product Manager and also Project Manager. 
              I live with my husband Ade, my dog Jackie and my 3 children David, 17, Tumelo, 11 and Stella, 3.

            <h3 class="interests">My Interests</h3>
                <p class="interests">
                  I am very much into working with my hands and producing things. Hence programming is perfect for me. 
                What I also do is sowing. I sow clothes for me and my daughter (the boys are not that interested in my clothes). Everything I sow is in ankara or similar fabrics. 

                Travel is also high up on my agenda. I went on my first trip abroad when I was less than a year and since then it has continued. I studied in the US for a year when I was a 
                teenager. After highschool I stayed with my uncle and aunty in their house in Rio for some months. I have worked in Spain when I was 15 and then I have also traveled alot in my jobs. 
                During this corona time we do not travel that much but otherwise we try to take a trip to Nigeria at least once every other year to visit my husbands family.

            <h3 class="curiosa">Curiosa about me</h3>
                <p class="curiosa">
                   I have held alot of jobs in my days. 
                   While studying I was working both as a croupier and as a car hostess showing off new car models to journalists. 
                   I have worked at McDonalds, in a reception, in customer service, as a tester, packing matches in a factory in Spain as well as assembling x-ray machines for Siemens. 
                   For the past 17years I have however worked within the telecom industry and believe I atleast have a grasp of that industry right now.
