                <p class="general">About me, well I guess this is I.  
              I was born 42years ago in Sabbatsbergs Hospital as the youngest of five children, and the only girl. 
              As the only girl I was offcourse spoilt, perhaps not by my parents, but by all of my brothers. 
              My mother had hoped for a girl to do girly things with but instead she got a daughter that assisted her father and brothers with fixing the cars and assembling things in the garage. 

              For the past 17 years I have worked within the telecom industry in various companies. At the moment I work as a Product Manager and also Project Manager. 
              I live with my husband Ade, my dog Jackie and my 3 children David, 17, Tumelo, 11 and Stella, 3.
